# Google Book Search
A online book search web app made with MERN stack.
## Overview
Some days are complete work then completed this beautiful task. I'm winning huge motivation through this great project. If you think about why we use this app? I think before the buy or reading any book it's great to read some details about the book and I'm sure my app SEO is very helpful for this.

Entering the home page and you see the login page, yes login is mandatory for free to feel this app journey. Complete your login process then nice. Don't worry, my app redirects to the 'search' page. Hopefully, you entered the 'search' page then you search the book and click on the book title. My app views some details of the book.
